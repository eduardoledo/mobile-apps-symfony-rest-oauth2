# Creating mobile apps with Symfony REST Services and OAuth2

This is a basic tutorial for creating from scratch a mobile app with OAuth2 authentication. This app will consume [RESTful Services](http://www.looah.com/source/view/2284) respecting the [HATEOAS constraint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS).

#### Components
We'll have three major components:
- [A service layer written in Symfony](services/index.md)(in-progress)
- An Android app (pending)
- An iOS app (pending)
